Hi! I'm benzarr, and I write simple, fun bash scripts for your Linux command line!

## How do I install this thing?
Now, to install this repo, it's quite simple.
First, download the zip.

Then, open the terminal. (Ctrl+Alt+T).

`cd` to the `command-line-fun-master` directory.

Mark the files as executable, either by right clicking, then going to Properties->Permissions->Allow this file to run as program, *or*, run this: `chmod +x ./<filename>`

Then, double click on the file, or run `./<filename>` And boom, it should run. If not, open an [issue](https://github.com/benzarr410/command-line-fun/issues).
## Program Explanations
8 Ball: Come on, it's a [Magic 8 Ball](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Magic_8-Ball).

Deathbattle: Fight someone (or something) to the death for glory! Or shame...

Discord Chat Generator: [Discord](http://discordapp.com) is a multiplatform chat service for gamers, and it has some silly antics that go on in its official servers. This script emulates that.
