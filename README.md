Hi! I'm benzarr, and I write simple/fun bash scripts for your Linux (and Windows, maybe) command line!

## How do I install this thing?
Now, to install this repo, it's quite simple.
First, download the zip.

Then, open the terminal. (Ctrl+Alt+T).

`cd` to the `command-line-fun-master` directory.

Mark the files as executable, either by right clicking, then going to Properties->Permissions->Allow this file to run as program, *or*, run this: `sudo chmod 755 ./<filename>`

Then, double click on the file, or run `./<filename>` And boom, it should run. If not, open an [issue](https://github.com/benzarr410/command-line-fun/issues).
